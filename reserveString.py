"""
You are given an array of characters which represents a string s. Write a function which reverses a string.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Input: s = ["n","e","e","t"]

Output: ["t","e","e","n"]

Example 2:

Input: s = ["r","a","c","e","c","a","r"]

Output: ["r","a","c","e","c","a","r"]
